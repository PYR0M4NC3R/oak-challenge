- FireRed & LeafGreen

I obtained the sprites for each Pokemon from [this page](https://archives.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Category:FireRed_and_LeafGreen_sprites). I think it'd be a good idea for us to use the sprites local to the game the checklist is for.
You can find sprites for other games by heading to [this page](https://archives.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Category:Game_sprites) and then selecting the appropriate generation, and then under that page select the game you want to get sprites for.

When working on a checklist, follow the below format/style (as seen in [frlg.html](https://github.com/PYR0M4NC3R/oak-challenge/blob/main/frlg.html)):
